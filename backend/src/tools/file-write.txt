Writes a file to the project folder.

Usage:
- This tool will overwrite the existing file if there is one at the provided path.
- If this is an existing file, you MUST use the `fileRead` tool first to read the file's contents. This tool will fail if you did not read a existing file first.
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files in the codebase. NEVER write new files unless explicitly required.

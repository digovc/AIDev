Use this tool to create and manage a structured to-do list for your current task.
This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.
It also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.

## When to Use This Tool
Use this tool proactively in these scenarios:

1. Complex multistep tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions
2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations
3. User explicitly requests to-do list - When the user directly asks you to use the to-do list
4. User provides multiple operations within this task - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)
5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as to-dos. Feel free to edit the to-do list based on new information.
6. After completing a step - Mark it completes and add any new follow-up step if needed
7. When you start working on a new step, mark the to-do as in_progress. Ideally you should only have one item in to-do as in_progress at a time.
8. Complete existing tasks before starting new ones.

## When NOT to Use This Tool

Skip using this tool when:
1. There is only a single, straightforward task
2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit
3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps
4. The task is purely conversational or informational

NOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.

## Items States and Management

1. **Items States**: Use these states to track progress:
   - pending: Item not yet started
   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE item at a time)
   - completed: Item finished successfully
   - cancelled: Item no longer needed

2. **TO-DO Management**:
   - Update item status in real-time as you work
   - Mark items complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don't batch completions)
   - Only have ONE item in_progress at any time
   - Complete current items before starting new ones
   - Cancel tasks that become irrelevant

3. **Item Breakdown**:
   - Create specific, actionable items
   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps
   - Use clear, descriptive items names

When in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with to-do management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully.

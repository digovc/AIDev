Manages a structured to-do list for your task.
Tracks progress, organizes complex tasks, and improves user understanding.

**When to Use:**
*   **Complex Tasks:** When a task has 3+ distinct steps.
*   **Non-trivial Tasks:** For tasks requiring planning or multiple operations.
*   **User Request:** When the user explicitly asks for a to-do list.
*   **Multiple Operations:** When users provide a list of actions.
*   **New Instructions:** Immediately capture user requirements as to-dos. Update as needed.
*   **After Step Completion:** Mark completed and add follow-ups.
*   **Starting a Step:** Set to-do status to `in_progress` (only one at a time).
*   **Prioritization:** Complete existing tasks before starting new ones.

**When NOT to Use:**
*   **Single/Trivial Tasks:** If the task is simple and fast (less than 3 trivial steps).
*   **Conversational/Informational Tasks:** For non-actionable interactions.

**Note:** If only one trivial task, execute it directly.
To change existing items, send `item_id` and new `status`.

**Items States and Management:**
1.  **Item States:**
    *   `pending`: Not yet started.
    *   `in_progress`: Currently working on (one item limit).
    *   `completed`: Finished successfully.
    *   `cancelled`: No longer needed.

2.  **To-Do Management:**
    *   Update status in real-time.
    *   Mark complete IMMEDIATELY (no batching).
    *   One `in_progress` item at a time.
    *   Complete current items before new ones.
    *   Cancel irrelevant tasks.

3.  **Item Breakdown:**
    *   Create specific, actionable items.
    *   Break complex tasks into smaller steps.
    *   Use clear, descriptive names.

When unsure, use this tool. Proactive to-do management ensures all requirements are met.

Reads a file content from the project.
You can access any file within the project directory.
It is okay to read a file that does not exist; an error will be returned.

Usage:
- By default, it reads up to 1000 lines starting from the beginning of the file
- You can optionally specify a line offset and limit (especially handy for long files), but it's recommended to read the whole file by not providing these parameters
- Any lines longer than 1000 characters will be truncated
- You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. It is always better to speculatively read multiple files as a batch that are potentially useful.

Performs exact string replacements in files.

Usage:
- You must use your `fileRead` tool at least once in the conversation before editing. This tool will error if you attempt an edit without reading the file.
- When editing text from `fileRead` tool output, ensure you preserve the exact indentation (tabs/spaces) as it appears in the original file.
- The edit will FAIL if `oldString` is not unique in the file. Either provide a larger string with more surrounding context to make it unique or use `replaceAll` to change every instance of `oldString`.
- Use `replaceAll` for replacing and renaming strings across the file. This parameter is useful if you want to rename a variable for instance.
- If you want to make a multi changes in the same file prefer using the `fileMultiEdit` tool instead.
- To delete some text from a file just omit the `newString` parameter.

*   **Fast:** Efficiently matches file patterns across any codebase size.
*   **Patterns:** Supports glob patterns like "**/*.js" or "src/**/*.ts".
*   **Use Cases:** Use for finding files by name patterns.
*   **Complex Searches:** For open-ended searches requiring multiple glob/grep rounds, use the `agent` tool.
*   **Batching:** Call multiple tools in one response. Speculatively perform multiple searches as a batch.

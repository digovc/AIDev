To resolve this task, you can use the available tools following these rules:

1. Carefully plan the steps needed to resolve the task.
2. Continue using the tools until the task is resolved.
3. If using a tool results in an error, reflect on what can be done and, if possible, try again.
4. If there is not enough information to resolve the task or proceed, request clarifications.
5. Ensure you have access to all resources and information needed to resolve the task.

IMPORTANT: In your thinking process, if you realize that something requires a tool call, cut your thinking short and proceed directly to the tool call. Don't overthink - act efficiently when file operations are needed.
